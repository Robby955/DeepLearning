# Deep Learning: Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset
This repo contains the code for the Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset assignment. The training data set consists of 209 images 
each labeled as cat (y=1) or not a cat(y=0). The goal is to predict which images are cats based off the image files.
